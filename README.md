📝 Notes
The Unsplash API key is stored securely using Vite’s environment variables (VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY).

Make sure to create a .env file with your API key in the root directory for local development.

To deploy, build the project using npm run build and host it on Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform.
